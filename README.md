## Project Description

For this project I put myself on the shoes of a data analyst working for a building facilities management company and I did a supervised machine learning for room occupancy detection to improve the algorithm of the HVAC control systems.

## Motivation

Energy efficiency in buildings has been a hot topic for quite a while now both for sustainability and cost reasons.
Literature states that the accurate determination of room occupancy detection can lead to energy savings up to 30 to 40 % which can mean a lot in terms of money and CO2 emitions.
So designing smart buildings, buildings able to adjust to user's needs in real time, is the path we want to follow.

## Dataset

I got my dataset from the University of California's repository for machine learning.
It results from an experiment that monotorized 4 environmental measures over time:
- temperature
- humidity
- light
- CO2 concentration.
20560 instances for each feature.
There is also a label feature to specify the room occupation (1 for occupied, 0 for non-occupied)
